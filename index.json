Such texts are easy to write and read. They can be easily converted to HTML. Most programmers prefer Markdown for writing documentation, describing their projects, writing blogs, and so on. Why is this needed? To add markup where no real markup is possible. For example, in a simple text file or in the same SMS, where it is impossible to bold, create headings, highlight quotes, etc. For more convenient writing of texts for subsequent conversion to HTML or other formats. Dialects and editors Very few people use basic Markdown anymore. But it has specifications and dialects that add new features to the language: embedding HTML tags, creating tables and checkboxes, strikethrough text, different line break options. Different Markdown editors may or may not support some of the new features - keep this in mind when choosing the platform on which you will work.\nThe most common Markdown is the GitHub Flavored Markdown dialect, which is based on the CommonMark specification.\n","date":1585872000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585872000,"objectID":"a0ade9b4b218a8a455292eee739b86e8","permalink":"https://example.com/post/markdown/","publishdate":"2020-04-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/markdown/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome üëã Today we find out what is Markdown language.","tags":["Markdown"],"title":"Markdown language","type":"post"},{"authors":["Natalia Sidorova"],"categories":["CI and CD"],"content":"Overview Continuous integration Developers using continuous integration merge their changes with the main branch whenever possible. The changes made by the developer are checked by creating an assembly and running automatic tests on this assembly. With this approach, you avoid integration difficulties when you have to wait for the release day to merge changes in the corresponding branch. When using continuous integration, much attention is paid to test automation, as a result of which, when integrating new commits into the main branch, the operation of the application is not disrupted.\nContinuous delivery Continuous delivery is a continuation of continuous integration, since it automatically deploys all code changes in the test and/or production environment after the build stage. Not only the testing process is automated, but also the product release process, so the application can be deployed at any time with a single click. Theoretically, with continuous delivery, you can release releases at any frequency relevant to the business. However, if you really want to benefit from continuous delivery, you should deploy to production as early as possible, ensuring that small change packages are released that are easy to find a bug in case of problems.\nContinuous deployment Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this approach, every change that goes through all the stages of the production pipeline is released to customers. Human intervention is not required, and the deployment of a new change to the production environment can only be prevented by an error during the test. Continuous deployment is a great way to speed up the customer feedback cycle and relieve the team of unnecessary stress by canceling the ‚Äúrelease day‚Äù. Developers can focus on creating software. They see how their code is put into operation in a matter of minutes, once finished. Simply put, continuous integration is part of both continuous delivery and continuous deployment. And continuous deployment is similar to continuous delivery, except that releases are done automatically.\nContinuous integration What will be required of you (expenses) ‚Ä¢ Your team will have to write automated tests for each new feature, improvement, or bug fix. ‚Ä¢ A continuous integration server is needed that can monitor the main repository and automatically run tests for each new commit sent. ‚Ä¢ Developers need to merge their changes as often as possible, at least once a day. What you will get ‚Ä¢ Fewer bugs get into the work environment, because due to automatic tests, deterioration is detected at an early stage. ‚Ä¢ When all integration problems are solved at the early stages, the release build is easy. ‚Ä¢ It is necessary to switch to another context less often, since developers receive a warning as soon as they break the build, and can work on a fix before moving on to another task. ‚Ä¢ Radically reduced testing costs: your CI server can run hundreds of tests in a few seconds. ‚Ä¢ The quality control team spends less time on testing and can focus on improving the quality culture.\nContinuous delivery What will be required of you (expenses) ‚Ä¢ Continuous integration requires a solid foundation. Your test suite should cover a sufficient part of the code base. ‚Ä¢ Deployments need to be automated. Although the launch is still done manually, no human intervention should be required after the deployment begins. ‚Ä¢ Most likely, your team will need to master the flags of opportunities so that opportunities that have not been completed do not affect the work of clients. What you will get ‚Ä¢ From now on, software deployment is no longer difficult. Your team no longer needs to spend several days preparing for the release. ‚Ä¢ You can release releases more often, speeding up the feedback cycle with your customers. ‚Ä¢ Decisions about small changes are made without unnecessary stress, which helps to speed up iterations.\nContinuous deployment What will be required of you (expenses) ‚Ä¢ Your testing culture should be at the highest level. The quality of your test suite will determine the quality of your releases. ‚Ä¢ The documentation process must keep pace with the pace of deployments. ‚Ä¢ Feature flags become an integral part of the process of releasing major changes. They provide an opportunity to coordinate work with other departments (such as support, marketing, PR, etc.). What will you get ‚Ä¢ You will be able to speed up the development process, as you will not need to interrupt it during releases. Deployment pipelines are triggered automatically every time changes are made. ‚Ä¢ The number of risks associated with releases is reduced and it is easier to release fixes in case of problems, since each deployment is carried out after making a relatively small number of changes. ‚Ä¢ Customers see a continuous stream of improvements, while the quality is improved every day, not once a month, quarter or year.\n","date":1583971200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583971200,"objectID":"01a4e7821669dc66b1241df632eac307","permalink":"https://example.com/post/ci_cd/","publishdate":"2020-03-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/ci_cd/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome üëã Today we find out what is Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, explore its pros and cons.","tags":["CI/CD"],"title":"Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)","type":"post"},{"authors":["Natalia Sidorova"],"categories":["post 1"],"content":"Overview Last week I was preparing for a calculus test.

You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively.
