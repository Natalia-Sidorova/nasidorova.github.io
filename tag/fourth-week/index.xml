      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I finally completed the operating systems labs and started learning German. Mathematics has become more difficult, but soon the tests and you need to understand these subjects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was warm and sunny in the first half of the week, so I visited the Moscow Zoo and the Botanical Garden of Moscow State University. It was exciting! I got a good impression and took a lot of beautiful photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
